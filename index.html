<h1><font color="#d15a00"/>Dear Members of American Trucking Association,</h1>



<h3>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I write to you today because I must share my concerns with you over increasing automation in the automotive industry and how it may impact your lives. As many of you are aware, self-driving cars exists and have been tested on many roads throughout the US. Over the last few years there has been an emergence of not only new self-driving cars, but also self-driving semis. This is an impending crisis for your community. While you have some time, (the technology is still maturing), it will not be long before you will have to compete for your job against a driver who doesn’t even exist! Some of you may retain your jobs, but many of you will not. I am writing to you all to warn you of the danger and to give my advice.
    <br/> 

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I understand that some of you are quite skeptical that these self-driving trucks will be able to contend with your skillset as a truck driver. It is true that at the moment, the self-driving trucks are sorely uncapable of performing all the tasks that you as a professional truck driver can. However, this will not be the case for long, as the technology is rapidly improving. Automation progress in cars is staggered in 6 stages, each with increased capabilities for self-driving. In stages 0 -2, cars fall into the more traditional roles, requiring someone to drive the vehicle, except for some steering or cruise control on limited roads and conditions. Next are stages 3-5, where automation becomes a greater force.  Stage 4 and 5 are most worrisome stages since this is where the trucks will be able to drive themselves. Now I will also admit that stage 5 (full automation) is a long way away, but what is quite close (within a few years) is stage 4 automation, fully self-driving within certain conditions. This could be well known routes and intercity deliveries. By the year 2020, most car companies will have some form of self-driving car in stage 3 or 4. The most advanced company is Tesla motors, which as of last year already has a set of cars with stage 4 automation. Furthermore, talking about Tesla, the company is releasing a fully automated electric semi, starting production in 2019, just one year away! Take a look for yourself. The truck is probably not yet stage 5 but, it will most likely operate extremely well on known routes, and can coordinate itself to travel in fleets, something that human truck drivers usually don’t do. 
	This must be concerning information to you. You must be asking yourself, what can be done or how should you fight this.  
    <br/> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me start off with what wont help. Denial and resistance. Denying that this problem can affect you will blindside you when you lose your job. Resisting change won’t help since technology will move on despite worker protests. Take the case of the American dock worker in the 1950’s. The introduction of a new way of shipping good in containers reduced the amount of dock workers “by over 90%” As you can see, not all jobs were lost with the transition, but almost all of them were. Truckers will face the same fate, not all your jobs will be gone, but there will only be enough left for a few. 
So what can you do? Here are some tips that will help prepare you for some of the consequences of automated trucks: 
    <br/> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Start learning other skills or go to school if possible to open more opportunities for yourself. If done correctly, your studies and effort could even lead to a better paying job and a job that is harder for automation to impact.
    <br/> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Start looking for other opportunities for employment. This is important, so you can be prepared and move to a new job when the need arrives.  I’m not saying that you need to quit now and switch to something else, but just be ready and know your options.
   <br/> 
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Save as much money as you can. This will help give you a lifeline of support if anything happens or if you lose your job out of the blue. If you have been working for a long time, you can use this to make smart investments to try and secure a safe retirement. 
<br/> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these are some measures to be prepared, the unfortunate reality is that many of you may lose your jobs. That why I want to reiterate the importance of being prepared and ask you to take this issue seriously. Those of you who are expert drivers, who drive in irregular conditions/routes, and those who are close to their retirement may not have too much to worry about. But the majority of you truck drivers will be impacted, so I strongly urge you to think about your future and prepare for what is to come.
